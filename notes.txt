In this example, we wrote two overloads: one accepting one argument, and another accepting three arguments. These first two signatures are called the overload signatures.
Then, we wrote a function implementation with a compatible signature. Functions have an implementation signature, but this signature can't be called directly. Even though we wrote a function with two optional parameters after the required one, it can't be called with two parameters!
